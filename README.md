# Behaviour cloning
# [Video](https://youtu.be/5uycedUIpGk)
This is the final project for the course "Practical robotics" at University of Stuttgart taught by Prof. Marc Toussaint. All the code is written based on RAI code of Prof. Toussaint. The goal of this project is to show how behaviour cloning can be done on the Baxter robot through a ball-picking
example. The experiment is set up with 3 different bins on the table. One bin is filled with balls of different colors (red or
green), the other two are empty. First, the human picks a ball of any color and drops it to any of the two bins.
The robot now observes and tried to replicate the same action.
